# Chocolatier Continued

## About

This is a continuation/re-imagining of [Ritsunesan](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/40687890)'s [Chocolatier](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5403) mod built from the ground up for **Stardew Valley 1.6** using **Content Patcher** and relying on the [Cornucopia Team](https://github.com/MizuJakkaru/Cornucopia/?tab=readme-ov-file#cornucopia-team)'s **Cornucopia mods** for the necessary prerequisites.

I do plan on this mod being cross-compatible with other mods, including making use of ingredients those mods add to the game if possible.

## Prerequisites

- SMAPI 4.x ([Website](https://smapi.io/)), ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)), ([Github](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases))
- Content Patcher 2.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915))
- Cornucopia - More Crops ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19508))
- Cornucopia - Artisan Machines *(coming soon)*
- Cornucopia - Cooking Recipes *(coming soon)*

## So&hellip; What's included?

### From Chocolatier 1.x

- ✅ Cocoa Butter *(in Cornucopia)*, Cocoa Powder, Powdered Milk, Vanilla Extract
