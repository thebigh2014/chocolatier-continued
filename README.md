# Chocolatier Continued

## About

This is a continuation/re-imagining of [Ritsunesan](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/40687890)'s [Chocolatier](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5403) mod rebuilt for **Stardew Valley 1.6** using **Content Patcher**, **Producer Framework Mod**, and relying on the [Cornucopia Team's](https://github.com/MizuJakkaru/Cornucopia/?tab=readme-ov-file#cornucopia-team) **Cornucopia mods** for the necessary prerequisites.

I do plan on this mod being cross-compatible with other mods, including making use of ingredients those mods add to the game if possible.

## Prerequisites

- SMAPI 4.x ([Website](https://smapi.io/)), ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)), ([Github](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases))
- Content Patcher 2.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915))
- Producer Framework Mod 1.9.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4970))
- Cornucopia - More Crops ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19508))
- Cornucopia - Artisan Machines *(coming soon)*
- Cornucopia - Cooking Recipes *(coming soon)*

## So&hellip; What's included?

### From Chocolatier 1.x

- ✅ Cocoa Butter *(in Cornucopia)*, Cocoa Powder, Matcha Powder, Powdered Milk, Vanilla Extract
- ✅ Chocolatier's Cauldron (machine)
- ✅ Base Chocolate Types: Milk, Semi-Sweet *(formerly dark)*, & White
- ✏️ Bonbons (heart shaped chocolates; perfect for Valentine's)
- 📋 Peanut Butter Cups, Coins, Turtles, Fudge *(as cooking recipes)*
- 📋 Covered Pretzels and Fruits *(as cooking recipes)*
- 📋 Boxes of Chocolates *(as crafting recipes)*

*The above items will __all__ be included in the initial release as well as anything needed and/or finished from below.*

#### 📍 So&hellip; Why Convert To Cooking/Crafting Recipes?

The simple answer is that it makes things a lot easier for everyone. Using a single machine is very constraining, especially with how the Producer Framework Mod works *(I'm not going to go into detail here)*. Also, it makes more sense for these to be cooking/crafting items. I will likely increase the time needed to make every cauldron item (the base and candy coating chocolate types) to compensate for the conversion to cooking and crafting (which are instant).

### Planned Additions

- ✅ Truffle Powder
- ✅ Base Chocolate Type: Bittersweet Chocolate (>60% Cocoa)
- ✅ Candy Coating *(aka Couverture)* Chocolate (in each base chocolate type; will be the primary ingredient for all covered items)
- ✏️ Bonbon Chocolate Press, Bar Chocolate Press, Chocolate Infuser (machines)
- 📋 Bars (flat, rectangular chocolates)
- 📋 Infusions (varyingly shaped chocolates infused with various ingredients)
- 📋 Truffles (decadent spherical chocolates made using truffle powder and/or oil; *will use Extruder, if possible, otherwise a new machine might be needed*)
- 📋 Sauces (somewhat akin to nut butters but featuring chocolate; *will use Butter Churn, if possible, otherwise a new machine might be needed*)
- 📋 Mousse Cups (soft and airy prepared chocolates)
- 📋 Chocolate and Caramel Eggs (bags of delicate small and large eggs; perfect for Easter)
- 📋 More varieties of the previous mod's products

#### 📍 So&hellip; Why More Machines?

The simple answer is, again, that it makes things a lot easier for everyone. Having a dedicated machine for each type of chocolate artisan good means more varieties are possible, again due to how the Producer Framework Mod works. I realize that this means a higher capital/initial cost to making various artisan goods but that's reality, right? If needed and/or requested, I may re-balance machine costs and/or artisan good prices in the future.
