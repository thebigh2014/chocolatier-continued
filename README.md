# Chocolatier Continued

## About

This is a continuation of [Ritsunesan](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/40687890)'s [Chocolatier](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5403) mod rebuilt for **Stardew Valley 1.6** using **Content Patcher**, **Extra Machine Configs**, and relying on the [Cornucopia Team's](https://github.com/MizuJakkaru/Cornucopia/?tab=readme-ov-file#cornucopia-team) **Cornucopia mods** for the necessary prerequisites.

I do plan on this mod being cross-compatible with other mods, including making use of ingredients those mods add to the game, if possible.

## Prerequisites

- SMAPI 4.x ([Website](https://smapi.io/)), ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)), ([Github](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases))
- Content Patcher 2.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915))
- Extra Machine Configs 1.3.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22256)), ([Github](https://github.com/zombifier/My_Stardew_Mods/tree/master/ExtraMachineConfig))
- Cornucopia - More Crops 1.5.x ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19508))
- Cornucopia - Artisan Machines *(coming soon)*
- Cornucopia - Cooking Recipes *(coming soon – required items will be embedded in my mod until its official release)*

#### ⭐️ My mod _will not be_ released _until after_ Cornucopia - Artisan Machines.

## So&hellip; What's included?

### From Chocolatier 1.x

- ✅ Cocoa Butter *(in Cornucopia)*, Cocoa Powder, Matcha Powder, Powdered Milk, Vanilla Extract
- ✅ Chocolatier's Cauldron (machine)
- ✅ Base Chocolate Types: Milk, Semi-Sweet *(formerly dark)*, & White
- ✏️ Bonbons (heart shaped chocolates; perfect for Valentine's)
- ✅ Peanut Butter Cups, Coins, Turtles, Fudge *(as cooking recipes)*
- ✅ Covered Pretzels and Fruits *(as cooking recipes)*
- ✏️ Boxes of Chocolates *(as crafting recipes)*

### New Items/Machines

- ✅ Base Chocolate Type: Bittersweet Chocolate (>60% Cocoa)
- ✅ Candy Coating *(aka Couverture)* Chocolate (in each base chocolate type; will be the primary ingredient for all covered items)
- ✅ Bonbon Chocolate Press (machine)

#### ⭐️ __All__ of the above items will be included in the initial release.

#### 📍 So&hellip; Why Convert To Cooking/Crafting Recipes?

The simple answer is that it makes things a lot easier for everyone. Using a single machine for all artisan goods is very constraining, especially with how machines work. Also, it makes more sense for some of these to be cooking/crafting items.

### Planned Additions

- ✅ Truffle Powder
- 📋 Bar Chocolate Press, Chocolate Infuser, and Truffle Extruder (machines)
- 📋 Bars (flat, rectangular chocolates)
- 📋 Infusions (varyingly shaped chocolates infused with various ingredients)
- 📋 Truffles (decadent spherical chocolates made using truffle powder)
- 📋 Sauces (somewhat akin to nut butters but featuring chocolate; *as cooking recipes*)
- 📋 Chocolate and Caramel Eggs (bags of delicate small and large eggs; perfect for Easter; *as cooking recipes*)
- 📋 Chocolate Drinks, including Hot Cocoa, Mochas, Milkshakes, etc.
- 📋 Chocolate Desserts, including Mousse Cups, Cakes, Pies, etc.
- 📋 More varieties of the previous mod's products
- 📋 Optional configuration settings to replace vanilla cooking recipes

#### 📍 So&hellip; Why More Machines?

The simple answer is, again, that it makes things a lot easier for everyone. Having a dedicated machine for each type of chocolate artisan good means more varieties are possible. I realize that this means a higher capital/initial cost to making various artisan goods but that's reality, right? If needed and/or requested, I may re-balance machine costs and/or artisan good prices in the future.
